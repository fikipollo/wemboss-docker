### About the eBioKit project

The eBioKit is a system running multiple open source web services on an Apple Mac-mini where all databases are stored locally.
This reduces the need for a fast internet connection while giving the users an opportunity to incorporate their data sets in widely used web services.

The eBioKit is developed by the SLU Global Bioinformatics Centre (SGBC), an academic research and educational initiative aimed to build a long-term successful bioinformatics infrastructure facility that serves the Swedish University for Agricultural Sciences (SLU) and life science research communities worldwide.
